Snow has fallen in the Sahara Desert in north-western Algeria as temperatures plummeted to below freezing. For children from nearby towns such as Mekalis, it was a welcome relief from the scorching heat of the world's largest hot desert. The ice crystals formed stunning patterns in the desert sands. Dunes - ideal for sliding - were also partially covered by the snow and ice. The snow in the town of Ain Sefra - known as the gateway to the Sahara Desert - was only a light dusting. Temperatures in the town, which is surrounded by the Atlas mountains, dropped below -2 for the last three nights but this is only a few degrees colder than average at this time of year, says BBC Weather's Nicky Berry. The snow was not a complete surprise - there were also falls in 2021, 2018 and 2017. But the snow on the red sand dunes in December 2016 did come as a shock. Residents of Ain Sefra said that it was the first time since 1979 they had seen snow, suggesting the phenomenon is now becoming more common. All images are subject to copyright
